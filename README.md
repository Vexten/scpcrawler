# TODO:
* - [x] Upload code to GitHub
* - [ ] Rewrite crawlers from functional to OO (would be easier to read)
* - [ ] Do more testing
* - [ ] Check if all necessary tags are excluded (admin, etc.)
* - [ ] Think about other interesting data to collect
    * - [ ] Possibly implement ways to extend container and crawlers
    * - [ ] Possibly implement ways to cluster entries (based on what?)
* - [ ] Write actual tests (maybe)
* - [ ] Make software more user friendly
    * - [ ] Implement serialization/deserialization
        * - [ ] Possibly implement reverse-compatible ways of extending serialized data
    * - [ ] Create a user interface
* - [ ] Implement data visulization
    * - [ ] Research data visaulization for web
    * - [ ] Possibly implement clustering entries (if ways to cluster are implemented)
    * - [ ] Integrate with GitHub Pages
* - [ ] Crawl through entire scp-wiki from 000 to 6999
* - [ ] Celebrate
